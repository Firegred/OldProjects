Greeting
phrase 1
Hello there... what is your name?
...
Oh, your name is <name>...
That is funny.. I seem to know you very well...
I did not even properly greet you.
You may wonder who I am.
Well... consider me as your friend.
You are stuck because of me...
And what am I?
A spirit...
But you may ask yourself... "Why did you choose me to be your friend?"
Well.. I didn't.
Someone else did...
And who is that someone else?
No one.. I lied... It is something that is reponsible for this.
And that something is a cursed snowball.
Have fun being trapped here forever :)
<end>
phrase 2
What is wrong?
Are you... afraid?
Do not be, I am here for you :)
What I am doing to you is for your own protection.
You may be wondering... why do you need protection?
Well... you may do something stupid.
Like burning to death... or getting killed by zombies...
...or by being trapped by me... >:)
Ha ha. I am only joking.
By being frozen by me, you cannot kill yourself.
But I never said anything about others killing YOU... :)
But who would want to kill you? ...
Definitely not me... I swear.
That snowball that hit you could have killed you.
But it did not... and now you are here... with me :)
Have fun! <3
<end>
phrase 3
It seems like you are trapped...
What will you do about it?
Nothing. 
You can try doing anything (and by anything, I really mean ANYTHING)
It will not change the fact that you are trapped.
Want to know the best part of being trapped?
You will be here forever! WITH ME <3
But why? ... Why will you stay here forever?
Because of a cursed snowball silly.
Someone threw it at your silly nilly face <3.
I really like your skin... it is nice.
Did you make it yourself? OR DID YOU STEAL IT LIKE A THIEF?
Ha ha. I only joke.
But seriously...
Enjoy being stuck here...
....WITH ME MWAHAHAHAHAHA
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
<end>
phrase 4
Woah! I found a new friend <3
Hi there... um... "What is your name again?"
Oh I remember, it is <name>
You may ask, "How do I remember you if we have never met?"
The answer to that question is simple...
I do not know you... I only read your nametag.
And you are now my newest friend <3
What do friends do? Hmm...
Oh.. I know. Friends tell each other jokes.
Knock knock
Who's there?
Friend
Friend who?
Friend who will keep you frozen forever. MWAHAHAHA
I suck at jokes, but that is ok..
You'll never leave me so have fun :)
<end>
phrase 5
I do not feel well, so let me make this quick.
You were hit by a cursed snowball.
I came out of the snowball and am now your friend.
As a friend, I trapped you.
So be a good friend and stay trapped.
Have fun being here with me! <3
<end>
<done>
OP Greeting:
phrase 1
Why hello there Mr Operator.
It seems you are trapped.
But why? ...
The answer is simple.
You were hit by a cursed snowball.
And I live in that snowball.
Now that I am free, I can do whatever I want.
But why do I choose to stay with you?
Because I feel lonely...
And I really need a new friend.
A powerful new friend...
Since OPs are so powerful, do you think you can get rid of me?
HAHAHAHAHA. YOU ARE SO FUNNY.
I have more power than you. :)
So have fun staying here for eternity.
MWAHAHAHAHA
<end>
phrase 2
Woah! I just met the operator!
Hi there operator. How are you today?
Good? Bad? Ha ha, it is all the same to me.
Right now, I am feeling excited.
Why am I excited?
Because I am with YOU!
I have never been friends with an operator before.
Do you know what I find funny?
I am actually more powerful than YOU right now! <3
Haha, you probably do not believe me. That is understandable.
You probably think there is some kind of command to get rid of me.
But nope, try everything. No player command can get rid of me :)
Did I ruin your day? ...I really hope I did not.
If I did, sorry. Nothing will change the fact that you are trapped.
Trapped by getting hit by a cursed snowball.
So take a seat, relax, and take a drink.
I am here for you :)
Have fun! <3
<end>
phrase 3
I really am not in the mood for talking.
So let me make this fast.
You are an operator. I am a friend.
You were hit by a cursed snowball.
You cannot do anything to get rid of me.
You will be trapped here forever.
Have fun..
<end>
<done>
Welcome back:
phrase 1
Welcome back! Did you miss me?
Well... I missed you. I felt really lonely.
While you were gone, there was no one I could talk to.
I could talk to myself, but that makes me feel sad :(
When I talk to you, I feel like the happiest spirit in the universe <3
Being your friend makes me feel amazing.
Friendship is magic... right?
I really hope I am right. Being wrong sucks :(
For some reason I feel sleepy... really sleepy...
I am going to take a nap.
Stay here... ok?
Don't leave me again!
<end>
phrase 2
Hey there friend!
You were gone for a while.
Were you gone for... seconds? minutes? hours? days? weeks?
I am not sure.
What is important is you are here now... with ME <3
I could talk to you all day... all night... all the time...
There is no where you can go.
You will always be here with me.
Do not freak out, you cannot go and hurt yourself.
Just stay here with me :)
<end>
phrase 3
Oh hey there!
I thought you died because you were gone for some time.
But that is ok... you are here now.
I am with you friend.

That will make me sad.
Well... Please stay here and not leave.
I <3 you.
<end>
<done>
Interruption
phrase 1
... ... ...
...I was talking to you...
And you decide to suddenly leave?
That really hurts my feelings :(
You know what... I am going to hurt YOU!

I bet you feel bad just like me..
Good...
Because you left me, I am going to leave YOU.
Have fun staying here...
<end>
phrase 2
... ... ...
...I thought you were my friend...
Friends are supposed to always be there for eachother. ALWAYS

I am going to go and think this over.
Stay here...
<end>

You did not hear everything I had to say! :(
That just ruins my day. RUINS IT...
I had fun talking to you about me...

I am going to cheer myself up.
In the meantime... make yourself comfortable standing here... forever
